## ⏱️ The Insider Rule: Timing Beats Location

A philosophical anchor.

PartyInsiders teaches:
- where matters less than when  
- the same venue is dead at 10pm and legendary at 1am  
- nights have phases  
- cities have rhythms  

This makes the platform feel intelligent and earned.

## 🌆 Cities Ranked by Party Intelligence (Not Hype)

- music spillover  
- tolerance for strangers  
- late-night food ecosystem

## 🚪 The “How to Enter” Pages (Massive)

This is the addiction engine.

Not:
- “Top 10 clubs”

But:
- how people get invited  
- what nights matter  
- what NOT to do  
- how to dress for that city  
- whether to show up alone or in a group  
- how to read the door vibe  

This is **social literacy** — rare and powerful.
