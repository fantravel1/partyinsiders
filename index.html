          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Getting into the real nightlife scene requires social intelligence, not just knowing venue names. Start by understanding the city's rhythm: what nights matter, what time locals actually arrive, and which neighborhoods hold the energy. PartyInsiders provides city-specific insider guides covering door etiquette, dress codes, timing windows, and the social codes that separate tourists from locals. The key principle: timing beats location. The same venue can be dead at 10pm and legendary at 1am."

In Buenos Aires, dinner starts at 10pm and clubs fill after 2am. In Seoul, the energy builds from midnight in Gangnam and Itaewon. In Mexico City, pre-drinks start around 11pm with club arrivals after midnight. PartyInsiders' city guides provide precise timing windows so you arrive when the energy is right, not when tourists show up."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Tourist trap clubs share common signs: aggressive promoters on the street, inflated cover charges, locations clustered in obvious tourist zones, and generic international music. To avoid them, look for venues in residential neighborhoods, check if locals actually go there (not just travel blogs), avoid anywhere with bottle service as the main draw, and pay attention to the crowd. PartyInsiders rates cities using the Insider-to-Tourist Ratio metric and guides you to neighborhoods where the real scenes thrive."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Respectful door navigation is about understanding the social contract. Arrive at the right time (not too early, not when there's a massive line), dress appropriately for that specific venue's culture, keep your group small (2-4 people), don't be visibly intoxicated, be genuine with door staff, and never name-drop or argue. In cities like Berlin, showing authentic interest in the music matters more than appearance. PartyInsiders' How to Enter guides provide city-specific door strategies that respect the venue's culture."

Tokyo's scenes range from streetwear to sharp tailoring depending on the district. Buenos Aires is effortlessly stylish. The universal rule: avoid looking like you're trying too hard or like an obvious tourist. PartyInsiders provides city-specific dress guides so you match the local energy without overthinking it."

Bars and smaller venues are easier solo than large clubs. Some cities like Mexico City and Lisbon are exceptionally solo-friendly. PartyInsiders provides solo-specific guides rating cities by approachability and offering strategies for meeting people naturally without the awkwardness."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Afterparties are the second location, the insider layer of nightlife. They work differently everywhere: in Berlin, clubs themselves run until Monday so the afterparty IS the club. In Buenos Aires, apartment gatherings with asado at 6am are standard. In New York, unlisted loft parties carry the energy. Afterparties are rarely advertised, they spread through word of mouth, social trust, and being in the right place. PartyInsiders' Second Location maps help you understand where the night continues without having to ask strangers awkwardly."

In Berlin, Kreuzberg and Neuk&ouml;lln over Friedrichstrasse. In Seoul, Hapjeong and Euljiro over only Gangnam. In S&atilde;o Paulo, Vila Madalena and Pinheiros hold incredible energy. PartyInsiders maps neighborhoods by late-night density, music variety, walkability, and food ecosystems so you can find the energy that fits your vibe."

Know when to arrive (hint: rarely before midnight). Eat where locals eat before going out. Avoid pulling out maps or phones constantly. Don't take photos everywhere.

Each city is scored across seven dimensions: Energy Density, Insider-to-Tourist Ratio, Scene Fragmentation, Gatekeeping Level, How Late Things Actually Start, Post-2am Options, and Random Magic Factor. This creates a nuanced picture of what nightlife actually feels like in a city, far beyond basic top-10 lists."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Hyped clubs and genuinely good clubs have different signatures. Hyped clubs rely on Instagram presence, celebrity name-drops, bottle service theatrics, and aggressive marketing. Genuinely good venues have consistent crowds of regulars, respected resident DJs or performers, minimal social media presence, and lines that move based on vibe not VIP lists. PartyInsiders reviews focus on who actually goes, what night matters, and what time it peaks rather than star ratings."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "After-hours culture varies by city. Some cities have dedicated after-hours venues. Others have late-night diners and food spots that become social hubs after 3am. Many scenes move to house parties, rooftop gatherings, or sunrise spots. In Berlin, the club doesn't close. In Mexico City, taquer&iacute;as become the afterparty. In Tokyo, izakayas and ramen shops absorb the post-club crowd. PartyInsiders maps these second locations for every city we cover."

            <div class="faq__answer">
              <p>Getting into the real nightlife scene requires social intelligence, not just knowing venue names. Start by understanding the city's rhythm: what nights matter, what time locals actually arrive, and which neighborhoods hold the energy. PartyInsiders provides city-specific insider guides covering door etiquette, dress codes, timing windows, and the social codes that separate tourists from locals. The key principle: <strong>timing beats location</strong>. The same venue can be dead at 10pm and legendary at 1am.</p>

            <summary class="faq__question">What time do locals actually go out?</summary>
            <div class="faq__answer">
              <p>Going-out times vary dramatically by city. In Berlin, clubs don't peak until 2&ndash;4am and run through Sunday afternoon. In Buenos Aires, dinner starts at 10pm and clubs fill after 2am. In Seoul, the energy builds from midnight in Gangnam and Itaewon. In Mexico City, pre-drinks start around 11pm with club arrivals after midnight. Our city guides provide precise timing windows so you arrive when the energy is right.</p>

            <summary class="faq__question">How do I avoid tourist trap clubs when traveling?</summary>
            <div class="faq__answer">
              <p>Tourist trap clubs share common signs: aggressive promoters on the street, inflated cover charges, locations clustered in obvious tourist zones, and generic international music. Look for venues in residential neighborhoods, check if locals actually go there (not just travel blogs), avoid anywhere with bottle service as the main draw, and pay attention to the crowd makeup. We rate cities using the Insider-to-Tourist Ratio metric and guide you to neighborhoods where real scenes thrive.</p>

            <summary class="faq__question">How do I get past a strict club door respectfully?</summary>
            <div class="faq__answer">
              <p>Respectful door navigation is about understanding the social contract. Arrive at the right time (not too early, not when there's a massive line), dress appropriately for that specific venue's culture, keep your group small (2&ndash;4 people), don't be visibly intoxicated, be genuine with door staff, and never name-drop or argue. In cities like Berlin, showing authentic interest in the music matters more than appearance. Our <strong>How to Enter</strong> guides provide city-specific door strategies that respect the venue's culture.</p>

            <div class="faq__answer">
              <p>Going out alone is not only okay &mdash; it's often the fastest way to meet people and experience authentic nightlife. Many cities have cultures that welcome solo socializing. Bars and smaller venues are easier solo than large clubs. Cities like Mexico City and Lisbon are exceptionally solo-friendly. We provide solo-specific guides rating cities by approachability and offering strategies for meeting people naturally.</p>

            <summary class="faq__question">How do afterparties actually work?</summary>
            <div class="faq__answer">
              <p>Afterparties are the second location &mdash; the insider layer of nightlife. In Berlin, clubs themselves run until Monday so the afterparty IS the club. In Buenos Aires, apartment gatherings with asado at 6am are standard. In New York, unlisted loft parties carry the energy. Afterparties are rarely advertised; they spread through word of mouth, social trust, and being in the right place. Our <strong>Second Location maps</strong> help you understand where the night continues.</p>

            <div class="faq__answer">
              <p>The Party Intelligence Index (PII) is our proprietary scoring system that rates cities not by hype but by real nightlife quality. Each city is scored across seven dimensions: Energy Density, Insider-to-Tourist Ratio, Scene Fragmentation, Gatekeeping Level, How Late Things Actually Start, Post-2am Options, and Random Magic Factor. This creates a nuanced picture of what nightlife actually feels like &mdash; far beyond basic top-10 lists.</p>

            <div class="faq__answer">
              <p>Hyped clubs and genuinely good clubs have different signatures. Hyped clubs rely on Instagram presence, celebrity name-drops, bottle service theatrics, and aggressive marketing. Genuinely good venues have consistent crowds of regulars, respected resident DJs, minimal social media presence, and lines that move based on vibe &mdash; not VIP lists. Our reviews focus on who actually goes, what night matters, and what time it peaks.</p>

            <div class="faq__answer">
              <p>Nightlife dress codes are city-specific and venue-specific. Berlin's techno scene favors dark, minimal, utilitarian looks. Miami and Dubai lean flashy and upscale. Tokyo ranges from streetwear to sharp tailoring depending on the district. Buenos Aires is effortlessly stylish. The universal rule: avoid looking like you're trying too hard or like an obvious tourist. Our city-specific dress guides help you match the local energy.</p>

            <div class="faq__answer">
              <p>After-hours culture varies by city. Some have dedicated after-hours venues. Others have late-night diners and food spots that become social hubs after 3am. Many scenes move to house parties, rooftop gatherings, or sunrise spots. In Berlin, the club doesn't close. In Mexico City, taquer&iacute;as become the afterparty. In Tokyo, izakayas and ramen shops absorb the post-club crowd. We map these second locations for every city we cover.</p>

            <div class="faq__answer">
              <p>Scene-respectful travel means understanding that you're a guest in someone's local culture. Don't blast venue names on social media. Don't take photos where it's not welcome. Tip well. Be kind to staff. Don't treat nightlife like a conquest. Leave spaces better than you found them. Our editorial policy intentionally avoids naming some venues to protect them &mdash; we focus on neighborhoods, vibes, and timing instead. The goal is to experience the scene, not extract from it.</p>

            <div class="faq__answer">
              <p>Leaving well is a skill. The best exits are casual, not dramatic: a quick goodbye to the people you're closest to, a message to your group that you're heading out, and a pre-planned transport option (ride-share app loaded, taxi number saved, route home mapped). Don't announce your departure to everyone. Don't try to convince others to leave. A clean exit keeps the energy intact for those staying and gets you home safe.</p>
